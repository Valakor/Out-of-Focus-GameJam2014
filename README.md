------
### **Brainstorming Ideas**
1.	[X] You possess certain things or people and you see certain perspectives based on the inanimate / animate object. Solve a puzzle.
2.	[X] Dating: You date a bunch of girls, it falls through. Brian's dating simulation featuring B.C. You realize you're gay at the end.
3.	[X] "Keep your distance from something and survive."
4.	[X] Force perspective. First person view of the game world. Door on moon. Huge gap in the tiny brick. (3D)
5.	[X] You're constantly falling, and things grow as they come close to you.
6.	[X] You're actually bad, but you do actions that make you seem like a good person. Plot twist. (Perspective)
7.	[X] Spy versus Spy. You're both spies spying for each other and the objective is to kill each other. (Omar)
8.	[X] You're a shitty mundane person (mechanic, plummer). You take mushrooms and you're huge and you squish things. (Jeffrey) - **THIS IS MARIO**
9.	[A] You can only see things based on your color. Example, you can see the path.
10.	[A] Cut the screen in half horizontally. Top screen and bottom screen with the child perspective up top, and the adult in the bottom. Use one puzzle in child or adult or both to solve puzzles.
11.	[A] I’m blue on my computer. Other person is yellow on his computer. Multiplayer with half job and other half job. Requires in-game or external communication between two people.
12.	[B] Tree falls in the forest, see or else it doesn’t exist or it's paused.
        a.	To you nothing is happening unless you’re looking at it so you take a picture
13.	[B] Memento and the photo idea.
14.	[?] One person can only hear, another touch, another see, another smell.
15.	[?] Because the world is boring, main character is on LSD.
16.	Two player game. Each player has different maps, but each player in the map has to communicate with another player within the game. Both need to deduce how to solve the end.
17. [X] "Everyone hates me because they think I'm shit. (The Introduction Title)". Platformer game while you're in the sewer, you're heading toward the ocean. You can be different type. (Watery, slushy, solid) and stick to walls with different abilities. You can replay when you get flushed at the end. Flagella shit. 
18. [?] Closer you get to a person, the narrow your field of vision becomes.
19. [?] Second person view, shooter. (3D)
20. [?] Random points in the game, the objective is to sabotage the enemy.
21. [?] First person horror game where you randomly switch roles.
